# Weather Forecast Project

This project is a web application that allows users to search for the current weather and forecast of any city in the world. It uses the [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to fetch the weather data and display it on the webpage. The project also demonstrates the use of async/await syntax to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

## Features

The application has the following features:

- A search bar that allows users to enter a city name and get the current weather and forecast for that city.
- A card that displays the current weather information, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
- A responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.

## Technologies used

The project uses the following technologies:

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end development.
- Tailwind for the UI framework and styling.
- Webpack for bundling and transpiling the code.
- Babel for converting ES6+ syntax to ES5.
- ESLint for code linting and formatting.
